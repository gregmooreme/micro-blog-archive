One of them had developed a seriously large lump and an x-ray revealed enough spread to conclude the whole set had to go.</p>\n\n<p>Add cat cancer to the long list of suck that’s making up 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Before we could pick Cora up though, the vet needed to prep us over the phone. With COVID-19, clinics now do all of their post-exam consultations via a phone call while you’re sitting in your car in their parking lot. It’s safer but it feels less like telemedicine and more like your pet got in trouble while at a terrible day camp.</p>\n\n<p>The vet informed us that surgery had gone great but her recovery was down to us spending the next nine days preventing one of God’s most independent animals from messing with a first painful, then itchy, line of stitches running down the left side of her chest and past her belly. It is a big deal but it shouldn’t be a big deal, oh and, do you have an empty spare room she could recover in? (Spoilers: We don’t.)</p>\n\n<p>To aid our impossible task, they would stick a cone over her head to prevent her from reaching her stitches or feeling at all normal. Also we could cover her weeping scar with one of the precious baby shirts we’d saved from our daughter’s childhood.\nMost importantly, the vet stressed three specific things to avoid while she healed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>No jumping</li>\n<li>No running</li>\n<li>No licking</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We assured him we understood, went and picked her up, and managed to break <em>all three</em> of his commandments within a minute of entering the house.  Even though we caaaaaarefully took the top off of the carrier as slooooowly as we could, she totally freaked, jumped out of the bottom half, and took off running. Her ever “helpful” sister, Dot, gave chase and pounced on her head cone. Now terrified, Cora ran/jumped up the stairs, stripping off the protective baby shirt so blood could get everywhere in the process, and scrambled under our bed with her sister in hot pursuit.</p>\n\n<p>I somehow I managed to wrangle Dot into another room so we could focus on how we’d get a panicked, wounded cat out from under the middle of a king-sized bed. Thankfully she wasn’t keen on exerting herself any further so she stayed put while we incredible-hulked the mattress off and removed some of the lower spring boards to more easily get to her. After carefully making sure she hadn’t reopened her stitches enough to require going back to the vet, my wife and daughter made up a quiet corner of the room while I puzzled out a way to extract her that didn’t involve further dismantling the bed. I didn’t want to stress her stitches any further so I figured I could use one of our already red beach towels as a makeshift stretcher. I scooted her onto the towel as slowly and methodically as I could and then lifted and balanced her while pulling the towel taught to keep her as flat as possible. It worked well enough but moving a screaming, bleeding cat is high on my “never again” list.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://blog.gregmoore.me/uploads/2020/eb1691aef3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe vet had to remove our cat, Cora’s, mammary glands from her entire left side this morning. One of them had developed a seriously large lump and an x-ray revealed enough spread to conclude the whole set had to go.\n\nAdd cat cancer to the long list of suck that’s making up 2020.\n\nBefore we could pick Cora up though, the vet needed to prep us over the phone. With COVID-19, clinics now do all of their post-exam consultations via a phone call while you’re sitting in your car in their parking lot. It’s safer but it feels less like telemedicine and more like your pet got in trouble while at a terrible day camp. \n\nThe vet informed us that surgery had gone great but her recovery was down to us spending the next nine days preventing one of God’s most independent animals from messing with a first painful, then itchy, line of stitches running down the left side of her chest and past her belly. It is a big deal but it shouldn’t be a big deal, oh and, do you have an empty spare room she could recover in? (Spoilers: We don’t.)\n\nTo aid our impossible task, they would stick a cone over her head to prevent her from reaching her stitches or feeling at all normal. Also we could cover her weeping scar with one of the precious baby shirts we’d saved from our daughter’s childhood. \nMost importantly, the vet stressed three specific things to avoid while she healed:\n\n1. No jumping\n2. No running\n3. No licking\n\nWe assured him we understood, went and picked her up, and managed to break _all three_ of his commandments within a minute of entering the house.  Even though we caaaaaarefully took the top off of the carrier as slooooowly as we could, she totally freaked, jumped out of the bottom half, and took off running. Her ever “helpful” sister, Dot, gave chase and pounced on her head cone. Now terrified, Cora ran/jumped up the stairs, stripping off the protective baby shirt so blood could get everywhere in the process, and scrambled under our bed with her sister in hot pursuit.\n\nI somehow I managed to wrangle Dot into another room so we could focus on how we’d get a panicked, wounded cat out from under the middle of a king-sized bed. Thankfully she wasn’t keen on exerting herself any further so she stayed put while we incredible-hulked the mattress off and removed some of the lower spring boards to more easily get to her. After carefully making sure she hadn’t reopened her stitches enough to require going back to the vet, my wife and daughter made up a quiet corner of the room while I puzzled out a way to extract her that didn’t involve further dismantling the bed. I didn’t want to stress her stitches any further so I figured I could use one of our already red beach towels as a makeshift stretcher. I scooted her onto the towel as slowly and methodically as I could and then lifted and balanced her while pulling the towel taught to keep her as flat as possible. It worked well enough but moving a screaming, bleeding cat is high on my “never again” list. \n",

Smiling up, Don identified with day moon. If his ex wife had any say, he too was expected to sink away with his failed former life and remain forever in it’s crumbled ruins but, like the day moon, Don chose to defy Earthly expectations and remain in the daylight. However, like the day moon, Don knew he couldn’t stay in the daylight forever. The daylight was for the young and the virgins. For the newly adult girls that encouraged him into one-night flings of passionate abandon. Not that he fought their advances. To be honest, he down right encouraged them; conceited and thankful for a youthful body that advertised him as a younger man. A less lived man. A man that hadn’t split his dreams apart to share with her, only to have them returned, stale and unused. Maybe that’s why he enjoyed this new sex so much. Their young and irresponsible passion fed his lost innocence and afforded him time to pretend he wasn’t weighed down with regret. In those moments, he could pretend to be just like them, living a life full of exuberant possibility. Pretending to share in the youthful optimism that springs from inexperienced ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>But he wasn’t like them, really, and the more he tried to trick himself into believing that he was, the less he could move on.

I’m fine. I merely forgot to check my boots before putting them on and I seem to have been bitten by something.” Reginald waved to the corner where the creature had retreated.”The little bugger headed over there.”</p>\n<p>“We better find him, sir.” Percy raised his upper lip as he squinted into the dark corner. “Could be dangerous, sir.”</p>\n<p>“Quite.” Reginald said as he tried to stand. Pain shot through the bite area causing him to hiss through gritted teeth.”You sure you’re alright, sir?” Percy asked.</p>\n<p>“I said I’m fine. Do make yourself useful, and help me find the damned thing.” Reginald said impatiently. He limped towards his desk and grabbed a large rock he had been using as a paperweight.

The pot dinged like a bell and the scarab hit the far tent wall with a soft puff.</p>\n<p>“That’s how you do it!” Reginald said proudly as Percy continued running around the room.</p>\n<p>“Settle down Percy!
