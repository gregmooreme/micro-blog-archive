				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a night owl. From as far back as I can remember, mornings have been something to endure before my real day starts. My parents and a long string of other type-a personalities have put consistent effort into changing me to no avail. It seems to be part of how I&rsquo;m made and no amount of habit changing has been able to reverse my late-leaning circadian rhythm.</p>\n\n<p>From getting terrible grades and dropping out of my college classes that started before 9 AM to working the early shift at Starbuck&rsquo;s, where we tossed back espresso shots like junkies, mornings always remained a struggle. Even when I moved to Japan and the timezone was flipped by 12 hours, my body quickly sussed out day from night and made me pay for it with every 5:30 AM wakeup. I resigned myself to the life of the permanently tired night owl trapped in the working world dominated by morning people.</p>\n\n<p>Then, near the end of 2008, everything changed.

				"content_text": "I've always been a night owl. From as far back as I can remember, mornings have been something to endure before my real day starts. My parents and a long string of other type-a personalities have put consistent effort into changing me to no avail. It seems to be part of how I'm made and no amount of habit changing has been able to reverse my late-leaning circadian rhythm.\n\nFrom getting terrible grades and dropping out of my college classes that started before 9 AM to working the early shift at Starbuck's, where we tossed back espresso shots like junkies, mornings always remained a struggle.
