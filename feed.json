It’s steady beam faintly illuminating the pause/play symbols on a set of headphones. Within their while plastic shell, small magnetic drivers pulse a faint rhythmic beat into a woman’s ears.<br>If this woman is listening, we can’t tell as she is making no expression. Her only sign of movement is the equally rhythmic rise and fall of her chest as she takes in and releases air.</p>\n<p>Minutes flow on with no change to the muted scene.<br>The headphones continue to pulse.<br>The woman continues to breathe.</p>\n<p>Before we loose interest, however, a car passes silently outside. The light from it’s headlights rush across the room and momentarily reveal a hidden world we couldn’t see before. Warm, red colored walls. Photographs framed in rough golden wood. The open door to what looks to be a bathroom. The silky shine on the folds of the woman’s pajamas as she lays above her covers.<br>Within this sudden visual revelation, we are also able to see a movement that we could not perceive before.

For the newly adult girls that encouraged him into one-night flings of passionate abandon. Not that he fought their advances.

A man that hadn’t split his dreams apart to share with her, only to have them returned, stale and unused. Maybe that’s why he enjoyed this new sex so much. Their young and irresponsible passion fed his lost innocence and afforded him time to pretend he wasn’t weighed down with regret.
